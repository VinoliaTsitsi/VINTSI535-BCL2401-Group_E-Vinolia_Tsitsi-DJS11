## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Podcast App is a React-based web application designed to allow users to browse, search, and listen to podcasts. It utilizes the [Podcast API](https://podcast-api.netlify.app/) to fetch data about shows, seasons, and episodes dynamically. Users can mark episodes as favorites, filter shows by genre, and enjoy a seamless audio playback experience.
